# Data/ Results Exaplanation 

## Data Information
- Data taken from census.gov household [pulse-surveys](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp1.html). 

- The first two datatables are utilizing survey's 3A and 3B, which use surveys to measure experiences with Food Insecurity in the past 7 days, as well as prior to the Coronavirus Pandemic. The first 7 weeks of the study, from April 23- June 16 2020 were utilized.

- The second dataset is from the _Recent Food Insufficiency by Household_ dataset, which comprises only information from respondents dealing with Food Insecurity

- Selections were taken from the _SeattleMetro_ sections of each dataset, representing a subsection of the large US dataset that is available.

- Rows that did not contain any information were processed as a ' - ' in the dataset, and were coverted to 0 values

## Conclusions/ Further Investigations

### Covid vs Prior Food Insecurity
- One statistically important conclusion taken from the first datasets utilized was the difference in total respondents dealing with Food Insecurity during COVID compared to their prior experiences. It was shown that a much larger amount of respondents stated they were currently feeling food insecure, compared to how they were doing prior to the start of the pandemic

- One intersting factor when considering the data, is the classification of food insecure. This dataset classified food insecure as either people who have Enough food, but not always the types wanted, Sometimes have enough food, and often don't have enough food. It would be worth to investigate how much of an impact the pandemic had on people who have enough food, but not always the types wanted, with the closures of grocery stores and food suppliers. 

### Reasons for Food Insecurity
- Another interesting conclusion from the second set of datasets, was the sharp increase of users at the start of the dataset stating that the reason for their food insecurity was _Not being able to get out to buy food_ coupled with the users also noting that they had enough food but not the right type.

- This data output goes into my hypothesis that many respondents of the survey were feeling the effects of the pandemic limiting the variety and types of food they are able to go out and buy. In particular, with the first weeks of data being in May, and lockdowns still being in effect in areas like Seattle, many respondents could have not felt comfortable returning to public areas like grocery stores.
